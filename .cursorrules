# Cursor Rules for dt4research

## Project Context
This is a cybernetic control system for digital transformation research (dt4research).
The project uses FastAPI, Pydantic, and Cytoscape.js for visualization.

## Development Rules

### Virtual Environment
- Always work in the virtual environment: `venv/`
- Activate using: `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (PowerShell) or `venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (CMD)
- All Python commands should use the venv Python executable

### Server Startup
- **ALWAYS use the start script**: `.\start_server.ps1` (PowerShell) or `start_server.bat` (CMD)
- The start script handles:
  - Virtual environment activation
  - Starting the FastAPI server with uvicorn
  - Proper logging and status messages
- NEVER run `uvicorn` directly - always use the start scripts
- PowerShell scripts must set UTF-8 encoding with `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8` for proper Ukrainian text display

### Code Style
- Write comments bilingual: English first, with Ukrainian in parentheses (e.g., `Compute delta (Обчислити дельту)`) 
- Use type hints (Pydantic, Python typing)
- Follow PEP 8
- Use docstrings for modules, classes, and functions
- Always use UTF-8 encoding for PowerShell scripts to support Ukrainian characters

### Workflow
- When user asks to "run/start the server", use the start script from root directory
- All new features should maintain compatibility with existing models
- Database is currently in-memory (SQLite-ready for future)
- We work on Windows with PowerShell terminals; do not use shell operator `&&`
- Do NOT perform any git commits or pushes without explicit user instruction; always ask for confirmation first

### Project Structure
- `app/` - Main application code
- `app/main.py` - FastAPI backend with endpoints
- `app/models.py` - Pydantic data models
- `app/agent_logic.py` - Rule-based AI agent
- `app/templates/` - HTML templates
- `app/static/` - CSS and JavaScript files
- `plan/` - Documentation and diagrams

### Key Models
- 9 Resource Types: Communication, Educational, Financial, Informational, Operational, Organizational, Risk, Strategic, Technological
- 5 Key Components: Strategy, Structure, Processes, Culture, Resources
- SystemState: Contains components and resources (in-memory database)

### Response Language
- Respond in Ukrainian for this project
- Documentation and code comments should be in English
